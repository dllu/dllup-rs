# Work

I work in what's called _Spatial AI_ nowadays. Basically, I have a decade of experience in making sense of the 3D world via [simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) with lidar, cameras, and other sensors, and more recently, stuff like Gaussian splatting. I currently work at NVIDIA on their self driving car project, on context fusion.

# Education

* **2014--2016**: [Carnegie Mellon University, M.S. Robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri_static_content.html?menu_id=469)
* **2008--2014**: [University of British Columbia, B.A.Sc. Eng. Phys.](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/)

At CMU, my advisor was [George Kantor](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?person_id=717).
I worked on [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) using a combination of cameras and a lidar, for an autonomous off-road vehicle.

My thesis is called [Vision-Enhanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping](/public/thesis.pdf). It is about combining several different SLAM algorithms, each with different strengths and weaknesses, so that a robot can function robustly in many different environments.
