This is a Rust project that generates a website using a unique markup language called "dllup", which is mostly similar to Markdown but with some subtle differences.

After making changes to the code, you can run `cargo check` then `cargo run -- example dllup.toml` to compile the example website. You should also aim to eliminate `cargo clippy` warnings.
